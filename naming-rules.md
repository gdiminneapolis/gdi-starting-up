# Some rules for naming files

Naming is one of the two hardest problems in computer science. Working on web pages introduces some rules you'll need to follow.

* names should be as descriptive as possible
* file names should not contain spaces
* files which will be used as URL addresses should be all lower case, contain no special characters except the dash `-` and period `.`. (There are a few more one could use, but restrict your names to just these)
* the dash `-` makes a good word spacer
* the period `.` is best use to set off the file extension (e.g.: `.html`, `.jpg`, `.css`)
* The file name `index.html` is reserved for the "Home" page in a directory. It is the file that the web server shows when there's a bare URL path, such as `http://mywebsite.com/`.



The other hardest problem is cache invalidation, which you should not be worrying about (yet). [Two Hard Things](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)
